## handle tight deadline in fin-tech platform

Situation

- When I joined A company, I was given the task of developing a fin-tech SaaS platform within a very limited time.

Task

- The challenge was to complete the platform's MVP on time, despite the tight deadline. I had to prioritize the most critical features and ensure the team could **handle the workload**.

Action

- I first broke down feature list into smaller, manageable parts and allocated them based on importance and urgency. Choose the most urgent and important features to prioritize development.
- After a few weeks of development, I realized that the team wouldn't be able to **meet the deadline**. I approached my boss to explain the situation and requested additional resources.

Result

- By re-prioritizing the tasks, adding more resources. we were able to complete the MVP on time, and the demo was successfully delivered to the client.

## developed internal service platform to optimized work flow

Situation

- When I was work for [XXX] company, at the end of the month, every employee need to submit an Excel report to HR department, detailing the time spent on each project every day.

Task

- I want to optimize this process, because everyone can't remember detail time at the end of the month.

Action

- I developed a web application where employees could log their working hours daily, and the system would automatically generate the required Excel report at the end of the month.
- The app included a simple UI for users to review.
- I also used chart to visualize the distribution of working hours per day. This way, everyone can better allocate their time

Result

- As a result, the time spent on reporting was reduced significantly. The team's efficiency also improved.

## had a conflict with a teammate

Situation

- In a previous project, I had a disagreement with a colleague over the best approach to a technical issue. Which is how to calculate the OHLC bar in market data display module.

Task

- To avoid delaying the project schedule. we need to quickly find a viable solution.

Action

- So, I initiated a discussion in our team to better understand each other's perspective. And discussed the implementation details
- We evaluated the pros and cons of both approaches, and in the end, we found
- The key to resolving the disagreement was open communication and focusing on the project's goals rather than individual preference.

Result

## Optimized light-weight chart

Situation

- When I worked in XXX company, there is a project our team planned use light-weight chart to display data.
- However, the library is not support scatter plot and multi panel rendering, but this two features that are critical to our needs.
- For example, we would like to overlay trading signal points (buy and sell points) on the K-chart and render multiple data indicators (e.g. MACD, RSI) on different panels to enhance the visualization capabilities.

Task

- so, I need to study the architecture of lightweight-charts to determine whether it can be extended for Scatter Plot and Panel rendering.
- And evaluate the **technical feasibility**, and assess the difficulty of implementing these features
- Estimate the **development effort** to provide a basis for team decision-making.

Action

- Researching lightweight-charts source code.
- To implement the Scatter Plot, I need to customize Series component, because I can reuse some of rendering logic, maybe 3-5 days can complete
- For multi panel rendering, required modify layout management logic, which may involve significant changes

Result

- The research led the conclusion that both two features can complete.
- Scatter Plot need normal workload, few days.
- Multi panel rendering is more difficult, need approximately one or two weeks.
- Since there was enough time, I developed these two features
- Finally, Scatter Plot and Panel Rendering are now successfully deployed in production environment.
