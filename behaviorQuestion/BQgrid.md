## handle tight deadline in fin-tech platform

Situation

- When I joined A company, I was given the task of developing a fin-tech SaaS platform within a very limited time.

Task

- The challenge was to complete the platform's MVP on time, despite the tight deadline. I had to prioritize the most critical features and ensure the team could **handle the workload**.

Action

- I first broke down feature list into smaller, manageable parts and allocated them based on importance and urgency. Choose the most urgent and important features to prioritize development.
- After a few weeks of development, I realized that the team wouldn't be able to **meet the deadline**. I approached my boss to explain the situation and requested additional resources.

Result

- By re-prioritizing the tasks, adding more resources. we were able to complete the MVP on time, and the demo was successfully delivered to the client.

## developed internal service platform to optimized work flow

Situation

- When I was work for [XXX] company, at the end of the month, every employee need to submit an Excel report to HR department, detailing the time spent on each project every day.

Task

- I want to optimize this process, because everyone can't remember detail time at the end of the month.

Action

- I developed a web application where employees could log their working hours daily, and the system would automatically generate the required Excel report at the end of the month.
- The app included a simple UI for users to review.
- I also used chart to visualize the distribution of working hours per day. This way, everyone can better allocate their time

Result

- As a result, the time spent on reporting was reduced significantly. The team's efficiency also improved.
