# Project Description

## Company A

### Data Management

#### about 4 person team

- When I joined A company, they gave me a huge task, which was to develop a fintech SaaS platform in a limited time, they needed a demo for our client. I think the challenge is time. So, I ranked the feature list by importance and urgency, then chose the most important features for our MVP scope.
- After a few weeks of development, I realized that we would not be able to complete even the MVP on schedule. Therefore, I approached our boss to discuss the situation and requested additional team members for the project.
- After that, 2 junior frontend developers and a backend developer with basic frontend knowledge joined to our team. So I needed to divide tasks (from larger to smaller) between them and keep track of everyone's progress.
- I assess the urgency and impact of each task, then focus on the high-priority items first. I also break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable parts and set clear milestones to track progress.
