# Project Description

## Company A

### Data Management

#### Introduce this project

#### about 4 person team

- When I joined A company, they gave me a huge task, which was to develop a fintech SaaS platform in a limited time, they needed a demo for our client. I think the challenge is time. So, I ranked the feature list by importance and urgency, then chose the most important features for our MVP scope.
- After a few weeks of development, I realized that we would not be able to complete even the MVP on schedule. Therefore, I approached our boss to discuss the situation and requested additional team members for the project.
- After that, 2 junior frontend developers and a backend developer with basic frontend knowledge joined to our team. So I needed to divide tasks (from larger to smaller) between them and keep track of everyone's progress.
- I assess the urgency and impact of each task, then focus on the high-priority items first. I also break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable parts and set clear milestones to track progress.

#### component library

#### about SharedWorker

- In the 'real-time data viewing’ module, to receive millisecond-level data sent by the backend.
- Need handle in frontend, classify and process the data. like calculate bar in a period time.
- Since the data arrives quickly, if too much data is processed on the page, it will cause the page to lag.
- I used a SharedWorker to create a separate thread for unified processing and throttled the data before returning it.
- In the main thread, I used requestAnimationFrame to trigger data changes, which made the previously laggy page smooth.

#### DevOps

Integrated Nacos to synchronize project configurations and injected them into environment variables during build time, enabling quick environment switching and increasing testing efficiency by 40%.
